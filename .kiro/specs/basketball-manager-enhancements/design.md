# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for enhancing the basketball manager game with advanced features. The design builds upon the existing Flutter application structure while introducing new data models, services, and UI components to support coach profiles, conference management, player roles, playbooks, real teams, and player development systems.

## Architecture

### Current Architecture Analysis
The existing codebase follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- **Data Layer**: Game data models (Player, Team, Manager, Conference, Game)
- **Service Layer**: GameService for Firebase integration
- **UI Layer**: Flutter pages and widgets with state management via ValueNotifier

### Enhanced Architecture
The enhanced system will extend the current architecture with:
- **Enhanced Data Models**: Extended classes with new attributes and behaviors
- **Service Layer Expansion**: New services for player development, playbook management, and team generation
- **UI Component Library**: Reusable components for complex data visualization
- **State Management**: Enhanced notifiers for real-time updates

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Enhanced Coach/Manager System

#### CoachProfile Class (extends Manager)
```dart
class CoachProfile extends Manager {
  CoachingSpecialization primarySpecialization;
  CoachingSpecialization secondarySpecialization;
  Map<String, int> coachingAttributes; // Offensive, Defensive, Development, Chemistry
  List<Achievement> achievements;
  CoachingHistory history;
  int experienceLevel;
  Map<String, double> teamBonuses;
}

enum CoachingSpecialization {
  offensive, defensive, playerDevelopment, teamChemistry
}
```

#### CoachingService
- Manages coach progression and bonuses
- Calculates team performance modifiers
- Handles achievement unlocking

### 2. Conference Management System

#### EnhancedConference Class (extends Conference)
```dart
class EnhancedConference extends Conference {
  List<Division> divisions;
  ConferenceStandings standings;
  PlayoffBracket playoffBracket;
  Map<String, TeamStats> teamStatistics;
  List<Award> seasonAwards;
}

class ConferenceStandings {
  List<StandingsEntry> entries;
  Map<String, int> headToHeadRecords;
  Map<String, double> strengthOfSchedule;
}
```

#### ConferenceService
- Manages standings calculations
- Handles playoff bracket generation
- Provides statistical analysis and rankings

### 3. Player Role System

#### PlayerRole Enum and RoleManager
```dart
enum PlayerRole {
  pointGuard, shootingGuard, smallForward, powerForward, center
}

class RoleManager {
  static Map<PlayerRole, List<String>> getRoleRequirements();
  static double calculateRoleCompatibility(Player player, PlayerRole role);
  static Map<String, double> getRoleBonuses(Player player, PlayerRole role);
}
```

#### Enhanced Player Class
```dart
class EnhancedPlayer extends Player {
  PlayerRole primaryRole;
  PlayerRole? secondaryRole;
  double roleCompatibility;
  Map<PlayerRole, double> roleExperience;
  PlayerPotential potential;
  DevelopmentTracker development;
}
```

### 4. Playbook System

#### Playbook Classes
```dart
class Playbook {
  String name;
  OffensiveStrategy offensiveStrategy;
  DefensiveStrategy defensiveStrategy;
  Map<String, double> strategyWeights;
  List<PlayerRole> optimalRoles;
  Map<String, double> teamRequirements;
}

enum OffensiveStrategy {
  fastBreak, halfCourt, pickAndRoll, postUp, threePointHeavy
}

enum DefensiveStrategy {
  manToMan, zoneDefense, pressDefense, switchDefense
}
```

#### PlaybookService
- Manages playbook creation and modification
- Calculates strategy effectiveness
- Applies game simulation modifiers

### 5. Real Teams Implementation

#### RealTeamData
```dart
class RealTeamData {
  static List<NBATeam> getAllNBATeams();
  static Map<String, Conference> getNBAConferences();
  static TeamBranding getTeamBranding(String teamName);
}

class NBATeam {
  String name;
  String city;
  String abbreviation;
  TeamBranding branding;
  String conference;
  String division;
  TeamHistory history;
}
```

#### TeamGenerationService
- Creates realistic NBA team rosters
- Generates authentic player names and attributes
- Manages team branding and visual elements

### 6. Player Development System

#### DevelopmentTracker
```dart
class DevelopmentTracker {
  Map<String, int> skillExperience;
  Map<String, int> skillPotentials;
  int totalExperience;
  double developmentRate;
  List<DevelopmentMilestone> milestones;
  AgingCurve agingCurve;
}

class DevelopmentService {
  static void awardExperience(Player player, GamePerformance performance);
  static void processSkillDevelopment(Player player, CoachProfile coach);
  static void applyAging(Player player);
}
```

### 7. Enhanced Player Generation

#### PlayerGenerator
```dart
class PlayerGenerator {
  static Player generateRealisticPlayer({
    required PlayerRole primaryRole,
    required int age,
    String? nationality,
    int? potentialTier
  });
  
  static List<String> generateRealisticName(String nationality);
  static Map<String, int> generateRoleBasedAttributes(PlayerRole role);
  static PlayerPotential generatePotential(int age, int tier);
}
```

## Data Models
