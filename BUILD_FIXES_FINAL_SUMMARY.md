The Basketball Manager app now builds successfully with no compilation errors. All critical issues have been resolved.

## 🔧 **Files Fixed**

### 1. **lib/views/pages/playbook_manager_page.dart**
**Issue**: `setActivePlaybook` method expected `String` parameter but was receiving `Playbook` object

- `import '../../gameData/enhanced_team.dart';`
- `import '../../gameData/enums.dart';`
- `import 'role_assignment_page.dart';`

**Result**: ✅ Warnings reduced
